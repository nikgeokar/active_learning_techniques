# Active Learning Techniques

### Introduction

This notebook aims to explore the effectiveness of active learning in improving machine learning performance when faced with a limited amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data. The traditional machine learning approach typically requires a substantial amount of labeled data to achieve satisfactory results. However, in many real-world scenarios, acquiring labeled data can be expensive, time-consuming, or impractical.

### Active learning techinque

Active learning offers a solution to this problem by intelligently selecting the most informative and uncertain samples from the unlabeled pool and adding them to the labeled set for training. By iteratively repeating this process, we can progressively improve the learning algorithm's performance without the need for large amounts of labeled data.

In our case, as we are dealing with a regression problem, we define the uncertain samples as those that have a longer distance from the mean of the predictions. This measure of uncertainty allows us to prioritize the samples that the model finds most challenging to accurately predict. By incorporating these uncertain samples into the labeled set, we aim to improve the model's understanding of complex patterns and enhance its ability to generalize.

### Comparison with Random Sampling

In this notebook, we will compare the active learning technique with a random sampling approach. The active learning technique involves selecting the most uncertain samples from the unlabeled pool based on some measure of uncertainty, such as entropy or margin. We will add these uncertain samples to the labeled set and retrain the machine learning algorithm. By doing so, we can evaluate the impact of incorporating these informative samples on the overall performance of the model.

### Objective

The objective of this notebook is to analyze and demonstrate how active learning can significantly enhance the learning process when faced with data scarcity. By comparing the performance of the active learning technique with random sampling, we aim to highlight the advantages and potential gains achieved through active learning. Through a series of experiments and evaluations, we will assess the impact of active learning on the overall model performance and showcase its potential as a powerful tool for efficient and effective machine learning with limited labeled data.
